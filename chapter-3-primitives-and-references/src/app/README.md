# Book App 

- I made a book object with the instance variables title and author.
- Then I tested it.
- I created a list of Book objects.
- I assigned each null value with a new book object to do so.
- I assigned the instance variables to the proper string type title and author.
- Then print out each book title and author with a while loop.
