# Method Overloading and Method Overriding

In Java, static polymorphism is achieved through method overloading. Method overloading means there are several methods present in a class having the same name but different types/order/number of parameters.
 The application for this example is the DemoOverload.java
 This app makes the compiler look at the method signature and decided which method to invoke for a particular method to call at compile time.

 In dynamic polymorphism calling the overridden method on the superclass reference then the subclass version of the method will be called.
 The application for this example is the MotorBike.java and Vehicle.java
 This demonstrates that the compiler determines which method to call at runtime based on the reference even if it has been overridden.
