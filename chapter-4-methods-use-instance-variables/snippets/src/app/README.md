## GoodDog App
The purpose of this app is to exercise the encapsulation skill discussed in the chapter. 
This is done to prevent someone seeing your instance variables and possibly altering them. You do this with the privaye access modifiers rather than the public one. This was done with comparing the size of a dog with the sound of its bark. This was done with an if, else if, and else statement.
