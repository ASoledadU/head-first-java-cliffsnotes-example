# Inheriting App
The purpose of this app is to practice inheriting from superclasses and overriding its methods by making it more specific to the class at hand.

- This is done by making a superclass that shows how the other classes are related. In this case, they are all `Animals`.
- Then making the specific animals. Which would be a `Dog`, `Cat`, and `Horse`.
- They all make a sound as said in the Animal class, but since they all make different sounds we need to override the method for the specific class. 
- You do this by making a method in that class you want to override.
- Now a cat can meow, a dog can woof, and a horse can neigh.
